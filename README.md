# Project Title: Sales and Revenue Analysis Dashboard

## Potential Problem to Solve:
This dashboard can be used to solve the problem of understanding and optimizing sales performance in a ride-sharing business. By analyzing hourly sales data, total revenue, rider demographics, profit margins, seasonal trends, and rider types, the dashboard provides insights into peak sales periods, rider behavior, and profitability. This information can help in strategic decision-making, marketing efforts, and operational improvements.

## Brief Introduction for Portfolio:
In today's data-driven business environment, leveraging analytics to gain insights is crucial for sustained success. To address this need, I developed a 'Sales and Revenue Analysis Dashboard' using Power BI. This dashboard is designed for a ride-sharing company to provide a holistic view of its performance across various dimensions.

## Key features include:

1. Hourly Sales Data Analysis: A detailed table displaying sales data on an hourly basis throughout the week, helping to identify peak times and potential areas for increased focus.
2. Total Revenue Calculation: An aggregated view of the company's total revenue, offering a snapshot of overall financial health.
3. Rider Count: A metric tracking the number of riders, which aids in understanding user engagement and growth trends.
4. Profit Margin Analysis: Insight into the profitability of operations, allowing for better financial planning and strategy.
5. Monthly Trend Analysis: Visualization of average revenue and profit trends from January to December, enabling seasonal performance assessment.
6. Seasonal Revenue Breakdown: An analysis of revenue by season, providing clarity on how different times of the year affect sales.
7. Rider Type Segmentation: Summarized data on the number of rides by casual and registered riders, helping to tailor marketing and retention strategies.

This dashboard not only provides comprehensive data visualization but also serves as a powerful tool for identifying trends, optimizing operations, and making informed business decisions."
